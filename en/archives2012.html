		<br/>			
			<p class="lead">The Youth of St Michael church presented a play entitled "The True Spirit of Christmas - 
Giving,Receiving and Believing" adapted from Charles Dickens'  well-loved classic, 'A Christmas Carol'. 
Under the guidance of Youth Co-ordinator Terry Jalleh and Stage and Costume Director Annie Fanciulli and Assistant Director Michelina George,
the play was met by an enthusiastic audience. The main protagonist,Ebenezer Scrooge, was brilliantly played out by lead actor Marco George. 
As Youth Co-ordinator Terry Jalleh mentioned, the play was a most appropriate way to close the liturgical
year's theme of "Telling the Story of Jesus". </p>

	<br/><br/><br/><br/>
			<h2 class="featurette-heading">Voter Education Forum - 5th May 2012</h2>
			
			<p class="lead">Our Parish Human Development Committee (PHDC) organised a Voter Education Forum on the afternoon of 5th May 2012. Speakers from both sides i.e the opposition and ruling party members were invited to engage with interested parishioners about voting in Malaysia. Unsurprisingly, no ruling party candidates bothered to show up. The forum was however fortunate to have had the presence of <a href="http://komas.org" target="_blank">Komas</a> director and Executive Director of Dignity International, Mr. Jerald Joseph and MP for Sungai Siput,Parti Sosialis Malaysia's Dr. Michael Jeyakumar.Eric Bryan from the Community Action Network (CAN) served as moderator for the forum.Monsignor Liew gave a short opening address. He pointed out that there had been some Christians who felt that priests should not be talking about politics from the pulpit. However, if the government of the day behaves in a manner that is oppressive, unjust and blatantly corrupt, it is the duty of all who claim to believe in a true and just God to speak up and stand up against these blatant wrong-doings. As Christians, it is imperative that we be pro-active in ensuring that the government of the day behaves in a just manner and governs in a manner that is free from corruption.</p><a href="../img/2012/photo0258.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="featurette-single pull-left img-polaroid" src="../img/2012/photo0258.jpg" width="169" height="130" border="1" align="right"></a>


<a href="../img/2012/photo0260.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="featurette-single pull-right img-polaroid" src="../img/2012/photo0260.jpg" width="169" height="130" border="1" align="left"></a><p class="lead">Both Jerald and Dr. Jeyakumar put forward the ideas that Malaysian voters need to think beyond 
just the present elections and removing shady politicians with blatantly corrupt practices 
that have become endemic in this country. The average Malaysian voter has to think further
beyond the ballot box, because a change in the ruling party may not necessarily
bring about an end to corruption and injustice if there are no changes in the mindset and
procedures of law and 'patronage-style' of business in this country. Dr.Jeyakumar also put forward the idea that capitalist ideals and Keynesian economic 
models may not necessarily be the only way of running a country effectively and efficiently.
The financial meltdown and constant issuance of more debt papers to get out of debt
in many capitalist-style western democracies have shown up weaknesses in these models.</p>

<p class="lead"> To detract from failed economic policies which weaken the nation, 
race and religion are always used as the preferred "weapon of choice" by the ruling national front. 
Unfortunately, even certain members of the opposition were not above playing the race card
 to gain voters whenever it suited their agenda. Until and unless Malaysians stopped looking 
and thinking in terms of race or religion
, the idea of a truly peaceful and progressive nation 
will never come to fruition. </p>

<p class="lead">  
Jerald in response to queries from the floor, mentioned that besides just voting, 
Malaysians can also help to increase awareness among their community about voter rights, 
volunteering their time and/or money to assist NGOs to verify the authenticity of the electoral roll,
vote counting. Dr.Jeyakumar,who runs a centre to assist the poor of Sg. Siput mentioned that
he often required volunteers in his work as one of his initiatives in Sg. Siput involves
giving tuition to poor children who had no means of attending national schools. 
The ruling government to date has given NO allocations for his work as an MP 
of that constituency just because he is not a member of the ruling national front.
 </p>

<p class="lead"> The session ended longer than scheduled at around 5.00p.m. PHDC chairman Mr. Albert Lim thanked
the forum presenters for their time and efforts in imparting their knowledge and views to the 
parishioners present. The PHDC then presented Jerald,Eric and Dr. Jeyakumar with fruit baskets as
a token of appreciation. </p>

<h2 class="featurette-heading">Blood Donation Campaign <img src="../img/2012/blood_drop.gif" width="50" height="60">-22nd April 2012</h2>

<p class="lead">A blood donation drive for Fatimah Hospital was held at the Parish Activity Centre of St. Michael's Church on 22nd April 2012. A big "Thank You"
to all parishioners and volunteers who helped to make this event a success.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h2 class="featurette-heading">Evening of Prayer,Reflection and Songs - 22nd February 2012</h2>

<p class="lead">Parishioners of St. Michael had the rare opportunity of listening to prayer reflections and songs by Fr. Cyprian Consiglio after the evening Ash Wednesday mass
 on 22nd February 2012. Fr. Cyprian Consiglio, OSB Com., a monk of the Camaldolese Congregation from the USA was on a visit to this region 
at the invitation of the Malaysian Community for Christian Meditation (WCCM). Fr. Consiglio kept the mood light and reflective, giving insights into the inspirations
for his song-writing. His melodious voice and the simple "unplugged" arrangement of guitar music kept parishioners enthralled for an hour. Parishioners
 were also invited to sing along with him, and surprisingly many did so with much gusto!  We thank the WCCM, Monsignor Liew and Fr Consiglio for this beautiful evening of songs and 
reflection. </p>

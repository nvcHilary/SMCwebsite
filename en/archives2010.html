		<h2 class="featurette-heading">Christmas Musical - 15th to 17th December 2010</h2>
		<p class="lead">The parish's Chinese Apostolate staged a Christmas Musical on 15th, 16th and 17th of December 2010.
Parishioners and students were treated to a beautifully executed play on the Nativity story
interwoven with a take on how the absence of Christ in our life can lead to an empty and somewhat 
dysfunctional modern family life. The performers portrayed their parts brilliantly and the costume
design was most impressive. Congratulations to the Chinese Apostolate on a job well done!

			<h2 class="featurette-heading">PHDC Jumble Sale - 12th December 2010</h2>

			<p class="lead">A jumble sale was organised by the PHDC of St. Michael in aid of the Mother Theresa Reading
Shelter in Buntong. Quality bags, shirts, books, magazines and knick-knacks were in abundance
for sale at marked down rates. Golf and handbags at RM5.00 and classic comics like Calvin &amp; Hobbes 
were a steal at only RM6 to RM10.00 each. The jumble sale raised approximately RM4,063.00 which was 
inclusive of a generous donation from a private donor. All proceeds will be channelled directly 
to the Shelter.</p>

			<h2 class="featurette-heading">Seoul Metropolitan Women's Choir Performance - 21st November 2010</h2>

			<p class="lead">Parishioners arriving early for the parish assembly were pleasantly surprised with a 
 performance by the award winning Seoul Metropolitan Women's choir from Korea.
The choir who were on tour, generously consented to giving their beautiful half-hour 
performance on an invitation from a member of the Parish Pastoral Council. 
Fr. Stephen Liew subsequently presented each member of the group with the parish's pewter keychains
as a token of appreciation from the parish. </p>
<br/><br/>
			<h2 class="featurette-heading">Parish Assembly - 21st November 2010</h2>

			<p class="lead">The parish assembly began at 2.30p.m. with an address from PPC Chairman Francis Fernandes,
followed by an opening prayer in Mandarin by Josephine Lim from the Chinese Apostolate.
Fr. Liew began his address by referring to the results of the review by the Peninsular Malaysia 
Pastoral Assembly in August 2010. The assembly stressed on the importance of family life and BECs.
There will be one Parish event and one BEC event for 2011.
Fr. Liew emphasised that family life and BEC needed to be strengthened and re-emphasised as 
human relations seem to have been diminished in this modern age 
of hypermarkets, condo living and other modern "advancements". 
He proposed that all families have one meal together (i.e. with all family members present
together at table) at least once a month. It was also decided that an inter-ministry/BEC Telematch 
be the Parish Event for 2011 while the BECs will hold a BEC fellowship in 
every BEC area simultaneously on a particular date to be decided upon later. </p>
<br/><br/>
		<h2 class="featurette-heading"> Farewell to Fr. Michael Cheah - 24th October 2010</h2>
		<p class="lead">Parishioners bid a fond farewell to Fr. Michael Cheah on 24th October 2010.
All choirs paid tribute to Fr. Cheah with their specially rehearsed songs at the end of each 
mass. Parishioners and well-wishers packed the Sun Lee How Fook restaurant for the lunch held in his honour,
on the same day. Friends from OLOL, OMPH and as far as Batu Gajah and Sitiawan were also present at the lunch
to say good-bye to Fr. Cheah.   A slideshow detailing Fr. Cheah's almost six year tenure in St Michael's church, 
was also shown during the lunch. A visibly moved Fr. Cheah thanked  all present for the co-operation and fellowship shown
throughout the years and hoped that the Parish would keep up this spirit of unity and faithfulness in
all years to come.</p>

		<p class="lead">Parishioners celebrated St Michael's Feast Day this year with the theme "120 years of Faithfulness" in conjunction with the Parish's 120 Years
anniversary.The mass was celebrated by His Lordship Bishop Antony Selvanayagam, together with our Parish Priests Fr. Michael Cheah and Fr. Anthony Chong.
Storm clouds and thunder which loomed threateningly in the late afternoon miraculously disappeared by the time mass started at 6.15p.m. </p>

		<p class="lead">The Ministry to the Poor was on hand to sell candles for the occasion and St Michael almond macaroons (cookies) specially baked for the 
occasion were also sold. Proceeds of these St Michael almond macaroons  benefited the Good Shepherd Sisters. 
The procession through Ipoh town went well thanks to fine weather and excellent assistance of dilligent hospitality ministers,
RELA and police personnel. </p>

		<p class="lead">The Parish also takes a moment here to express grateful thanks to the visiting priests,Fr. Francis Xavier
Selvarajoo, Fr. Martin Then and Fr. Victor Louis for their inspiring sermons on the theme of "Faith, Hope and Charity"
